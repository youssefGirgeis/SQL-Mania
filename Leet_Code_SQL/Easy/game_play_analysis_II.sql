/*
Table: Activity

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| player_id    | int     |
| device_id    | int     |
| event_date   | date    |
| games_played | int     |
+--------------+---------+
(player_id, event_date) is the primary key of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some game.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played 
a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on some day using some device.
 

Write a SQL query that reports the device that is first logged in for each player.

The query result format is in the following example:

Activity table:
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |
| 1         | 2         | 2016-05-02 | 6            |
| 2         | 3         | 2017-06-25 | 1            |
| 3         | 1         | 2016-03-02 | 0            |
| 3         | 4         | 2018-07-03 | 5            |

-------- Solution 1----------
SELECT 
    a.player_id,
    a.device_id
FROM activity a
JOIN (
    SELECT
        player_id,
        MIN(event_date) first_logged_in
FROM activity
GROUP BY player_id
) b
ON a.player_id = b.player_id
    AND a.event_date = b.first_logged_in

---------- Solution 2 --------------
SELECT
    DISTINCT player_id,
    first_value(device_id) OVER(PARTITION BY player_id ORDER BY event_date) device_id
FROM activity

Result table:
