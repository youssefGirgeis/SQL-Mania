Popularity of Hack

Facebook has developed a new programing language called Hack.To measure 
the popularity of Hack they ran a survey with their employees. 
The survey included data on previous programing familiarity as well as 
the number of years of experience, age, gender and most importantly satisfaction with Hack.
